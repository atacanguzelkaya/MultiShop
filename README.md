# MultiShop Microservice Project

This project is a real-world e-commerce system built using a microservices architecture. The application follows clean code principles and adheres to SOLID practices for maintainability and scalability. It leverages technologies like Docker, Dapper, and Redis, and works with databases including MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and MSSQL. IdentityServer4 is used for user authorization, while an API Gateway is implemented with Ocelot. The system supports various authorization scenarios for logged-in users, guest users, and admins.
